# amapGeocode

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->
**amapGeocode** provides an interface for the AutoNavi(高德) Maps API geocoding services. API docs can be foun [here](https://lbs.amap.com/) and [here](https://lbs.amap.com/api/webservice/summary/). For now, amapGeocode can be used for both forward and revese geocoding powered by high-precision AutoNavi Maps API.

It's very common for API upgrades to make the downstream application, like amapGeocode, to be unavilable. Feel free to [let me know](mailto://chenhan28@gmail.com) once it's broken or just open an issue.
## Installation
amapGeocode may be published to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) once the first available version been finished.

For now, please install amapGeocode from GitHub following this command:
```{r install by remotes}
# remotes::install_github('womeimingzi11/amapGeocode')
```

<!-- You can install the released version of amapGeocode from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("amapGeocode") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(amapGeocode)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!

Geocoding and Reverse Geocoding Services are widely used to provide data about coordinate and location information, including longitude, latitude, formatted location name, administrative region with different levels. There are some package can provide geocode service such as [tidygeocoder](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidygeocoder), [baidumap](https://github.com/badbye/baidumap) and [baidugeo](https://github.com/ChrisMuir/baidugeo). However, some of them not always provide precise information in China, and some of them is unavailable with upgrade backend API.

amapGeocode is built to provide high precise geocoding and reverse gecoding service, and it provides an interface for the AutoNavi(高德) Maps API geocoding services. API docs can be foun [here](https://lbs.amap.com/) and [here](https://lbs.amap.com/api/webservice/summary/). Here are two main functions to use are `getCoord()` which takes a character location name as an input and `getLocation()` which takes two numeric longitude and latitude values as inputs.

The `getCoord()` function extracts coordinate information from input character location name and output the result as `tibble`, `XML` or `JSON (as list)`. And the `getLocation()` function extracts location information from input numeric longitude and latitude values and output the result as `tibble`, `XML` or `JSON (as list)`. With the `tibble` format as output, it's highly readable and easy to be used to `tidy` workflow.

This project is still in a very early stage and only the geocoding function has been developed. So all the functions may change or supersede, so it's not recommended to use this package in production environment till it goes to stable stage. When will the stable stage come? It depends my graduate progress.

amapGeocode is inspired by [baidumap](https://github.com/badbye/baidumap) and [baidugeo](https://github.com/ChrisMuir/baidugeo). If you want to choose the Baidu Map API, these packages are good choice.

Baidu or AutoNavi? Here is the main differences:

1. AutoNavi has significant high precise, in my case, the Results from Baidu were unsatisfactory.
2. Baidu with free verification provides really high request: 300,000/month for each geocode/reverse-geocode, while AutoNavi only provide 6,000/month.

## Installation
amapGeocode may be published to [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) once the first available version been finished.

For now, please install amapGeocode from GitHub following this command:
```{r install by remotes, eval=FALSE, message=TRUE, include=TRUE}
remotes::install_github('womeimingzi11/amapGeocode')
```

<!-- You can install the released version of amapGeocode from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("amapGeocode") -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Usage
### Geocoding
Before start geocoding and reverse geocoding, please apply a [AutoNavi Map API Key](https://lbs.amap.com/dev/). Set `amap_key` globally by following command:

```{r set amap_key, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
options(amap_key = 'REPLACE THIS BY YOUR KEY')
```

Then get result of geocoding, by `getCoord` function. 

```{r getCoord_to_table_as_TRUE}
library(amapGeocode)
res <-
  getCoord('成都中医药大学')
knitr::kable(res)
```

The response we get from **AutoNavi Map API** is **JSON** or **XML**. For readability, we transform them to `tibble`, [a modern reimagining of the data.frame](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), by setting `to_table` argument as `TRUE` by default.

If anyone want to get response as **JSON** or **XML**, please set `to_table = TRUE`. If anyone want to extract information from **JSON** or **XML**. The result can further be parsed by `extractCoord`.

```{r getCoord_to_table_as_FALSE}
res <-
  getCoord('成都中医药大学', to_table = FALSE)
res
```

`extractCoord` is created to get result as tibble.

```{r extractCood}
res
tb <- 
  extractCoord(res)
knitr::kable(tb)
```
### Reverse Geocoding

get result of reverse geocoding, by `get` function. 

```{r getLocation_to_table_as_TRUE}
res <- 
  getLocation(104.043284, 30.666864)
knitr::kable(res)
```

The response we get from **AutoNavi Map API** is **JSON** or **XML**. For readability, we transform them to `tibble`, [a modern reimagining of the data.frame](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/), by setting `to_table` argument as `TRUE` by default.

If anyone want to get response as **JSON** or **XML**, please set `to_table = TRUE`. If anyone want to extract information from **JSON** or **XML**. The result can further be parsed by `extractLocation`.

```{r getLocation_to_table_as_FALSE}
res <-
   getLocation(104.043284, 30.666864, to_table = FALSE)
res
```

`extractLocation` is created to get result as tibble.

```{r extractLocation}
res
tb <- 
  extractLocation(res)
knitr::kable(tb)
```

For more functions and improvements, Coming Soon!

## Bug report
It's very common for API upgrades to make the downstream application, like amapGeocode, to be unavailable. Feel free to [let me know](mailto://chenhan28@gmail.com) once it's broken or just open an issue.
